# Word-Game

You are required to design and implement a “Word Game” program in which the user must identify a randomly selected “password” from a list of 8 words.  The 8 words are selected at random from the list of 100 words in the starter file (word_game.py) provided to you with this assignment brief.  Please use thestarter file as the basis of your assignment code.The user has 4 attempts in which to guess the password (the number of words in the list and number of  guesses  depend  upon  the  difficulty  the  user  selects,  but  that  is  not  important  in  this  overview).  Whenever they guess  incorrectly, they are told how many of the letters  are the  same  between the word they guessed and the password.  For example, if the password is “COMEDY” and they guessed “MOULDY”, they would be told that 3/6 letters were correct due to the O, D and Y being the same.  Note that a letter must be in the correct positionto be correct.  e.g. In the example above, both words contain the letter “M” but it is in a different position in the word so it is notcounted as a correct letter.Using this information, the user can make increasingly knowledgeable guesses and win the game by selecting the password.  If the user fails to select the password within 4 guesses, they lose the game.This game is similar to the game of “mastermind”, and is based upon the hacking minigamefrom the Fallout video games.  You do notneed to be familiar with those games to complete the assignment.The entirety of this programcan be implemented in under 115lines of code(although implementing optional additions may result in a longer program).  This number is nota limit or a goal –it is based upon an average quality implementation that includes comments and blank lines.  It is simply provided to prompt you to askyour tutor for advice if your program significantly exceeds it.
